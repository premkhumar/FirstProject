Based on the detailed scenario provided for **Laxman Gurung**, here’s a potential case disposition for the transaction monitoring:

---

**Case Disposition:**

**Client Profile Review:**
- The focal entity, **Laxman Gurung**, is a **37-year-old salaried individual** employed as a **Medical Claims Administrator** at **Gurkha Welfare Scheme Nepal**, with a payroll account at SCB since 2008. The client's monthly salary is noted to be NPR 61,450.00, and the account history generally aligns with regular payroll transactions.

**Source of Funds (Credits):**
- **Credits totaling NPR 4,131,115.53** were received in the period from 12/06/2024 to 25/07/2024, including:
  - **Disbursement Credit** of NPR 4,000,000.00 received on **30/06/2024** as a **loan to support the construction of the client's mother-in-law’s house** at her own plot in Pokhara.
- These credits are well-documented and supported by a loan reference indicating the purpose of the funds, which appears legitimate and aligned with the client's stated purpose of home construction.

**Transaction Analysis (Debits):**
- **Debits totaling NPR 4,084,324.16** were made over 35 counts in the same period, which include:
  - **RTGS debit of NPR 2,800,000.00** to **Raju Gurung** (client’s father-in-law) on **07/07/2024**.
  - **Self-cheque debit of NPR 999,999.00** on **07/07/2024**.
- The high-value debits correspond to the loan proceeds received and were likely used for the stated construction purpose, as indicated by the significant RTGS transfer to the client’s father-in-law (Raju Gurung), and the self-cheque debit.
- Lower-value transactions (ATM withdrawals, POS debits, and others) appear to be for personal or routine expenses and are insignificant in comparison.

**Counterparty Analysis:**
- **Raju Gurung** (client’s father-in-law) was the recipient of the RTGS debit. A **potential name match** was flagged under Adverse Media during the World Check screening, but the **secondary identifiers** could not verify the exact match. Other screenings (Accuity, Kharon) returned **false positives** or **no match**.
- **Sanju Gurung**, the client’s spouse and the daughter of **Raju Gurung**, is a related party, but no further adverse findings or concerns were noted regarding her involvement.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **PEP and AM Screening** performed on the focal entity and counterparties flagged some matches, but all were determined to be **false positives** based on differences in the watchlist entries and identifiers.
- **No RFIs** were initiated for this case, as the supporting documents (loan reference, employment details) provide sufficient clarity on the source and utilization of the funds.

**Conclusion:**
- The **source of funds** from the loan appears legitimate, supported by loan documentation stating the purpose as home construction.
- The **large debits** (RTGS to Raju Gurung and self-cheque) align with the stated purpose of supporting the construction of the house.
- There is **no suspicious activity** identified in this case, and the transactions are consistent with personal and family-related financial activities.
  
**Disposition: Risk Irrelevant.**
