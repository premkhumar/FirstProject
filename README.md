- **Number of Transactions:** 4  
- **Period:** 28/07/2024 to 06/08/2024  
- **Narration:** “PERSONAL USE”  
- **Counterparty:** Self-transfer to **Pratap Sing Rai**

The debits were IBFT transactions, marked for personal use, suggesting these were internal fund transfers between accounts owned by **Pratap Sing Rai**. These types of self-transfers are typically used for personal financial management, like moving funds between different accounts for savings, investments, or other expenses.

#### **Source of Funds for Triggered Debits:**
- **Total Credit Amount:** NPR 1,615,027.84  
- **Source:** **STS salary credits** from The Gurkha Welfare Trust Nepal  
- **Number of Salary Credits:** 10  
- **Period:** 19/10/2023 to 25/07/2024  
- **Employer:** The Gurkha Welfare Trust Nepal

The source of funds for the debits is well-documented and legitimate, as the salary payments were credited by the client’s employer, The Gurkha Welfare Trust Nepal. This further establishes that the triggered debits were likely for personal financial management.

### **Counterparty:**
- **Gurkha Welfare Trust Nepal**  
  - **Account Number:** GBP / 01-0268097-57  
  - **LOB (Line of Business):** Foreign Embassies & Trade Representatives  
  - **Role in Case:** Employer of Pratap Sing Rai

The counterparties in this case do not include any external entities aside from the employer, which is a well-known organization supporting retired Gurkhas. As the salary funds came from this trusted source, there is no indication of suspicious or unknown external funding.

### **Analysis of Previous Cases:**
- **Previous Risk-Relevant Cases:** No prior cases were found, nor any open cases at the Act stage on **Pratap Sing Rai**.  
- **Risk Level:** Both the primary and secondary clients have a risk code of **B**, which places them in a moderate risk category, likely due to their status as foreign nationals or their business profile.

### **Observations:**
1. **Source of Funds:**  
   The funds used for the debits were sourced from legitimate salary credits from a trusted employer, The Gurkha Welfare Trust Nepal. No unusual or unexplained sources of income were noted.

2. **Self-IBFT Transfers:**  
   The debits in question were self-transfers, meaning the client was simply moving their own funds between accounts. This type of transaction is quite common for personal financial management and doesn’t typically raise red flags unless there are additional suspicious factors.

3. **Narration:**  
   The debits were tagged as “PERSONAL USE,” which is consistent with self-transfers. This further corroborates the notion that the funds were being managed for personal reasons, without any indication of suspicious activity.

4. **Client’s Profile:**  
   As an employee of The Gurkha Welfare Trust Nepal, Pratap Sing Rai is a salaried individual with a steady income of NPR 250,000 per month. His employment and income level are consistent with the transaction amounts observed. 

5. **No Triggered Credits:**  
   No credits were triggered in the review, meaning there were no unexpected or unusual inflows during the transaction period.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Risk Level:** Low to moderate. The client’s profile, steady income, and legitimate source of funds provide confidence that these transactions are routine personal transfers.  
- **Disposition:** Based on the available information, there is no evidence of suspicious activity. The self-IBFT debits are explained by personal financial management, and the salary credits provide a legitimate source of funds. Thus, the case can likely be closed as **Risk Irrelevant** unless further unexpected patterns emerge in future reviews.

### **Next Steps:**
- **Monitor for Future Patterns:** Though no significant concerns were found in this review, continued monitoring of future transactions is recommended. If there is an increase in transaction volume or frequency beyond the client’s regular salary, further investigation may be warranted.
