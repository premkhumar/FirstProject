#### **Case Observations and Findings:**
1. **Client Profile:**
   - Rajendra Giri, aged 63, is a self-employed business owner of Sirus Money Transfer. He has a steady monthly income of NPR 200,000, which is in line with his business activities.
  
2. **Triggered Credits:**
   - The client received self-cheque credits totaling NPR 23,000,000 over three transactions, with the largest single credit being NPR 12,500,000 on 27/12/2023.
   - One of the credits, NPR 10,000,000, is explained as proceeds from the sale of an asset, which is an acceptable source of funds for such a large amount.

3. **Triggered Debits:**
   - The debits from the account, which total NPR 36,700,000, include both self-cheque debits and new deal creation debits. The funds were transferred to new deposit accounts (e.g., NPR 12,500,000 on 27/12/2023 and NPR 11,200,000 on 25/07/2024).
   - The source of these debits aligns with the credits in the account, indicating that funds have been moved between accounts for business or investment purposes.

4. **No Third-Party Transaction Risk:**
   - All transactions reviewed involve self-cheques or transfers between the client's own accounts, which minimizes the risk of third-party involvement or money laundering.

#### **Conclusion:**
- The client's activities seem consistent with his profile as a business owner in the money transfer industry. The large debits and credits are backed by sufficient explanations, such as asset sales, and the funds move within accounts controlled by the client.
- Screening results ruled out any suspicious activity or risk, and no significant third-party involvement is noted.

Given the findings, this case could potentially be closed as **Risk Irrelevant** after verifying the legitimacy of the asset sale and reviewing the pattern of fund movement across the client's accounts.
