- **Reviewed Debits**:
   - **Self outward wire transfer debit** in 01 count made on **25/07/2024**, identified as being for personal purposes. The source of funds is clear and legitimate, hence no concerns noted.
   
   - **Ibanking fund transfer debits to Suraj Joshi** (Account Number: **18288572701NPR**) in 03 counts made during the period **25/07/2024 to 31/07/2024**. As **Suraj Joshi is the client’s spouse**, these transfers are considered normal family-related financial support. The purpose of these transactions aligns with the client’s personal financial needs, and no concerns were noted.

   - **New Deal Creation Debit** (TRF TO NEW DEPOSIT: **92648970003**) made in 01 count on **26/07/2024**. This debit represents a fixed deposit (FD) creation, which is an investment made for financial security and interest credits. It is common for individuals to engage in such investments, and upon maturity, the funds can be used for personal purposes. Hence, this debit is considered normal and part of the client’s financial planning.

- **Source of Funds for Triggered Debits**:
   - The source of funds for the triggered debits includes the above-mentioned credits and the following:
      - **STS credits from UNICEF COUNTRY OFFICE** in 06 counts received during the period **25/01/2024 to 24/06/2024**, identified as regular salary credits from the employer, with no concerns noted.
      - **Matured fixed deposit credits** (FROM DEPOSIT **92648970001**) in 01 count received on **10/10/2023** and (FROM DEPOSIT **92648970002**) in 01 count received on **27/02/2024**. These funds were sourced from the client’s prior investments, showing a pattern of legitimate financial planning.

- **Transaction Review**:
   - Upon reviewing the **Ibanking fund transfers** and **outward wire transfers**, the transactions appear to be personal in nature, including routine financial support to family members and the creation of new fixed deposits for future financial security.
   
   - Other transactions that were triggered were insignificant in value and appear to be for personal purposes, hence they were not reviewed further.

   - Considering the client’s age (35 years) and employment history, as well as the fact that the client has maintained a regular salary with an average monthly income of **NPR 176,047.23** from UNICEF, the transactions are consistent with the client’s financial profile and capacity.

   - The **client’s prior fixed deposits** further demonstrate a history of responsible financial management, and the source of funds for these matured FDs is deemed to be from the client’s accumulated savings and investment returns.

- **Mitigation of DS Large Reportable Transactions**:
   - Though the transaction was flagged under **DS Large Reportable Transactions** due to significant value, upon review, it was determined that the transactions are consistent with the client’s profile and involve personal financial management and investments. The source and purpose of the transactions are clear, and no anomalous activities were found. The risk associated with the DS is mitigated, as these are normal transactions for an individual with the client’s financial capacity.

- **Conclusion**:
   - Given the client’s long-standing relationship with SCB, her regular salary credits from a reputable employer, and the clear purpose behind her debits, there are no suspicious indicators related to the triggered transactions.
   - The **IBanking fund transfers to the spouse**, **self wire transfers**, and **investment-related debits** are all within the expected financial behavior for someone in the client’s profile.
   
- **Disposition**:
   - Based on the above findings, the case is **closed as Risk Irrelevant**, with no concerns identified in the client’s transaction behavior.
