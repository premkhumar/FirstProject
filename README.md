  - **Arachnys and other screenings** were not performed for this existing client.

### **Analysis and Key Observations:**
- The client, **BHUPENDRA RAM SHRESTHA**, holds a **Savings Account** under the **Consumer Banking** segment. The account has seen **significant cash deposits** labeled as **"LOAN FROM GLOBAL IME BANK LTD"**.
- These funds were quickly withdrawn through a **cheque debit** and **ATM withdrawals** shortly after the cash deposit was made, which raises a red flag concerning the quick utilization of the loan amount.
- The debits made correspond exactly to the credited amount, indicating that the transaction is more likely related to loan disbursement and repayment rather than typical personal or business activity.
- The employment details and income suggest a modest financial background, making the high volume of transactions notable in relation to the client’s declared monthly and annual income.
  
### **Conclusion:**
- **Risk Mitigation:** The client's transactions, though large, are explained by the cash deposit reference **“LOAN FROM GLOBAL IME BANK LTD”**. The funds were disbursed as part of a loan, which aligns with the debits made shortly after the deposit. Since no unusual activity or other suspicious counterparties are identified, and the source of funds is linked to an established bank loan, the transactions appear legitimate.
  
- **Next Steps:** 
  - If no other major transactions are noted within the past one-year transaction review, the current transaction pattern can be considered a **one-off instance**.
  - No further review is required unless the client’s future activity shows similar high-volume transactions without corresponding references or justifications.
