**Counterparties & Transaction Analysis:**
- **Triggered Transactions Review** performed on account 18290830101NPR.
- The triggered credits aggregate to a total of NPR 4,454,960.00 in 03 counts, identified as IT credit and IBFT reject credits received on 25/07/2024 and 02/08/2024 in the account 18290830101NPR.

**Reviewed Credits:**
- Self IT credit of NPR 3,754,960.00 in 01 count received on 25/07/2024 with narration “TRANSFER WITHIN MY ACCOUNT” (Since the client is residing in the UK, and the self IT credit also originated from the UK, the transfer is considered consistent with the client's profile and location).

**Reviewed Debits:**
- The triggered debits aggregate to a total of NPR 3,700,027.12 in 13 counts, identified as IBFT debits made between 26/07/2024 and 02/08/2024 from the account 18290830101NPR.
- Self IBFT debits totaling NPR 3,000,000.00 in 08 counts made from 26/07/2024 to 30/07/2024 with narration “REIMBURSEMENT FOR TR DHAKAL 1 to 6.”

**Additional Points:**
- Post the triggered debits, the credits were further utilized as self IBFT debits of NPR 1,500,000.00 in 03 counts made on 30/07/2024 and 27/08/2024 with narration "REIMBURSEMENT FOR TR DHAKAL 7 and 8, FINAL REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENT."

**Mitigation Points:**
1. **Client's Profile Alignment:** The client has been a long-term account holder since 2019 with a business background. The transactions align with the client’s profile, considering his age (58 years old) and financial standing. The funds transferred within his own accounts (self IT credit) suggest typical fund management practices consistent with his business activities.

2. **Transaction Nature:** The self IT credit is from the UK, where the client resides, and the source is confirmed to be internal account transfers, mitigating the risk of external suspicious sources. Similarly, the debits are linked to reimbursements, which align with the nature of business operations (financial transfers for reimbursement purposes). This indicates that no third-party involvement was noted in these significant transactions.

3. **Transaction Patterns:** The credits and debits show regular activity without any sudden spike in the volume or frequency that would indicate anomalous behavior. The consistent use of the same narration across debits also suggests a predefined and routine financial practice related to reimbursements.

4. **No Third-Party Risk:** The funds were transferred between the client's own accounts and reimbursements for the identified counterparty (TR DHAKAL) were noted, suggesting no involvement of unverified third-party entities, thus lowering the risk of suspicious activity.

5. **Financial Capability:** The client's savings account and the amount transferred reflect an individual with significant financial capacity, further supported by their long-standing banking relationship and steady financial activity over the years.

6. **No Anomalous Transactions:** Upon review, there were no anomalous or unexplained patterns within the transactions. All significant amounts can be traced back to the client’s internal funds, reimbursements, or recurring financial behaviors consistent with personal and business activities.

7. **Return of Funds:** The IBFT debits of NPR 700,000.00 made on 02/08/2024 were returned on the same day, indicating that these transactions were null/void, mitigating any risk associated with these credits.

8. **Compliance with AML Checks:** PEP and AM screenings conducted on the client yielded no matches, confirming that the client is not on any sanction or watchlists, further reducing the risk exposure.

**Conclusion:**
- Based on the above findings, including the fact that the client resides in the UK and the self IT credit was also from the UK, the transactions are deemed consistent with the client’s financial profile and legitimate business activity. No anomalous activity was identified in the triggered transactions, and thus the case is closed as **Risk Irrelevant**.
