To address areas of concern for this case, here are key points that need to be considered:

### 1. **Third-Party Transactions:**
   - **Issue:** Atish Dangol is routing third-party transactions, specifically from his father-in-law and possibly other family members, through his personal account.
   - **Concern:** This is against banking norms for personal accounts, which should only reflect the account holder’s own financial activity.
   - **Action:** Atish Dangol has been advised to refrain from routing third-party funds through his account. It's important to monitor if this advisory is adhered to in future transactions.

### 2. **Source of Funds:**
   - **Issue:** NPR 10,386,000 credited from Ratna Shanker Shrestha & Arati Sarkar Shrestha for land sale.
   - **Concern:** Although this is explained as proceeds from a land sale by family members, the large volume of funds and the consistent nature of credits raises a concern about whether this pattern will continue. It may indicate an ongoing reliance on third-party funds.
   - **Action:** Confirm and document that the land sale is a one-time transaction, and further investigate if future large inflows from third parties are observed.

### 3. **Debits to Multiple Counterparties:**
   - **Issue:** Multiple high-value debits to individuals including Budhi Bahadur Gurung, Kailash Bikram Bista, and others.
   - **Concern:** There is a pattern of large debits across several individuals, which could suggest business-like activities or personal investments that are beyond regular personal account usage.
   - **Action:** Ensure clarity on the purpose of these transactions. Although the client states they are related to land investments, further verification may be required to ensure that there is no undeclared business activity happening through the account.

### 4. **Watchlist Matches:**
   - **Issue:** Potential hits were found for Budhi Bahadur Gurung (involvement in gambling) and Phul Maya Chaudhary (human trafficking).
   - **Concern:** Even though there is no secondary identifier for these matches, the association with individuals flagged for adverse activities still presents a risk.
   - **Action:** Conduct enhanced due diligence on any future transactions with these individuals to ensure no illegal activities are being funded or supported.

### 5. **Client Education:**
   - **Issue:** Repeated third-party transactions.
   - **Concern:** Despite being advised, there remains a risk that the client could continue routing family or business-related funds through his personal account, increasing exposure to compliance risks.
   - **Action:** A follow-up with the client should be planned to reinforce the importance of adhering to personal banking rules and ensuring no third-party business transactions are routed through the account.

### 6. **Outdated CDD Review:**
   - **Issue:** The last CDD review for both clients was outdated, especially Priya Shrestha’s, which was last reviewed in 1900, likely a data entry error.
   - **Concern:** Outdated reviews pose a compliance risk, especially with non-resident clients who could have changes in their financial profile.
   - **Action:** Update the CDD review immediately and ensure the client’s current financial standing, risk profile, and residency status are accurately captured and reflected in the system.

By addressing these areas of concern, the case can be managed more effectively, and potential compliance risks can be mitigated.
