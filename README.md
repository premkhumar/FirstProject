### Red Flags Identified in the Case of Ujen Paljang:

1. **Unemployed Status vs. Significant Credits and Debits:**
   - Ujen Paljang is listed as unemployed, yet the account shows significant transaction activity, particularly credits of substantial amounts (NPR 548,000, NPR 1,128,831.83, NPR 691,500.00, NPR 562,500.00). This is inconsistent with the profile of an unemployed individual, raising concerns about the legitimacy of these funds.
   
2. **Unclear Source of Funds:**
   - Multiple IBFT credits from various sources such as IME LIMITED, PAYWELL SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT, KESHAB PRASAD SAPKOTA, and NEW BHAIRAHAWA SUNCHADI PASAL without clear and documented business relationships or employment records. The narrative mentions "Pray and Puja materials," but no concrete evidence is provided to support this claim, making the source of funds appear vague.
   
3. **Use of Remittances for Non-Business Purposes:**
   - The client claims that the credits are from his brother, friend, and relatives for the purpose of purchasing "Lama Puja materials." However, remittance laws generally require transparency, and using remittances for non-family business or third-party activities can raise questions about the legitimacy and intended use of funds.
   
4. **Frequent and Large ATM Withdrawals:**
   - The client has made NPR 1,075,000.00 worth of ATM withdrawals in 52 counts over a period of 5-6 months, which is unusual for personal expenses. Frequent large withdrawals may indicate attempts to avoid financial transparency and documentation.

5. **Vague Business Relationships:**
   - The client is linked to Keshab Prasad Sapkota and Soman Narayan Biswok, who are said to be involved in financing Lama Puja material purchases. However, there are no clear business agreements, contracts, or formal relationships provided, leaving the purpose of transactions ambiguous.

6. **Self Cheque Debit without Clear Explanation:**
   - The client made a self-cheque debit of NPR 690,000.00, allegedly for "Lama Puja material expenses." Given the magnitude of this amount, the explanation seems insufficient, particularly without invoices or receipts to validate the purchase.

7. **New Deal Creation Debits:**
   - Several high-value debits (e.g., NPR 700,000 and NPR 500,000) were transferred into new deposit accounts, which could indicate attempts to compartmentalize funds and obscure the trail of money flow. Without a clear purpose, this raises potential red flags of layering or structuring.

8. **Third-Party Transactions via a Personal Account:**
   - The client admits to receiving funds from friends and relatives for facilitating religious activities. Conducting these third-party transactions through a personal savings account, rather than a business account, could indicate attempts to bypass proper scrutiny and evade tax liabilities.

9. **Multiple Large Fixed Deposits:**
   - Matured fixed deposit credits of NPR 700,000.00 and NPR 500,000.00 were observed. The source of these fixed deposits, as well as their purpose, remains unclear, especially given the unemployed status of the client.

10. **Inconsistency in Account Usage:**
    - The client claims that the account is used for assisting friends in religious activities. However, the high volume of transactions, including both IBFT credits and large ATM withdrawals, suggests that the account may be used for other purposes, potentially including undisclosed business activities.

### Suggested Next Steps for Further Investigation:
- **Source Verification:**
  - Request additional documentation, such as invoices, receipts, or contracts, to substantiate claims related to the purchase of religious materials.
  
- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):**
  - Given the high volume of transactions, inconsistent account activity, and the client’s unemployment status, performing Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is warranted. Investigate the origin of the funds, the nature of the relationship between the client and his "friends" or "relatives," and the actual purpose of the transactions.
  
- **Transaction Monitoring:**
  - Continuous monitoring of the account for further suspicious activity, especially large withdrawals or unexplained credits, is recommended.

- **Involvement of Other Authorities:**
  - If necessary, report the client to relevant financial or regulatory authorities for further investigation, particularly if the client’s activities appear to involve money laundering or tax evasion.
