Scenario Summary:
The client is receiving funds from their deceased spouse's account, as they are the nominee.
The client is also receiving pension credits.
Funds are being utilized for fund transfers to the client's son and daughter, as well as for new deal investments.
Disposition:
Source of Funds:

The primary source of the funds is from the client's deceased spouse, transferred to the client’s account due to the client being the nominee. The transfer of funds is legitimate and follows standard banking procedures for a nominee after the death of an account holder.
Additionally, the client is receiving pension credits, which are expected to be consistent and regular. The pension is an accepted source of legitimate income, further reducing any concerns about unexplained or sudden credits.
Utilization of Funds:

The funds have been transferred to the client's son and daughter. This aligns with typical personal financial management, where family members often assist each other financially.
The rest of the funds have been used for "new deal investments," which appears to be an investment-related transaction. This is considered normal and aligns with the expected financial behavior of someone managing their inherited funds and pension income.
Risk Assessment:

Low Risk: The source of the funds is clear (from the spouse's account and pension credits), and the purpose of fund utilization (family support and investments) appears consistent with the client’s financial situation.
No Business Transactions Noted: There is no indication that the client is using their personal account for business purposes, which further reduces the risk.
Monitoring for Future Patterns: While the current pattern of transactions is consistent with the client's personal situation, it is recommended that future transactions be monitored for any sudden increases in volume or frequency, especially large unexplained transfers, which may require further investigation.
Conclusion:

Based on the above findings, the current transactions are considered personal in nature and low-risk. As there is no indication of suspicious behavior or concerning patterns, the case can be closed as Risk Irrelevant.
However, the account should continue to be monitored for any changes in transaction patterns, particularly if the frequency or amounts of transfers increase unexpectedly.
