Here's an enhanced version of the case disposition with additional details for a more comprehensive analysis:

---

**Case Disposition:**

**Client Profile Review:**
- The focal entity, **Laxman Gurung**, is a **37-year-old salaried individual** employed as a **Medical Claims Administrator** at **Gurkha Welfare Scheme Nepal**, holding a **payroll account** at SCB since **2008**.
- The client has a steady monthly income of **NPR 61,450.00**, as per the loan documentation. Historical transactions show consistent patterns of salary credits and regular personal expenditures.

**Source of Funds (Credits):**
- **Credits totaling NPR 4,131,115.53** were received in 4 transactions between **12/06/2024** and **25/07/2024**. The significant credit was:
  - **Disbursement Credit** of **NPR 4,000,000.00** on **30/06/2024**, explicitly noted as a **loan to support the client’s mother-in-law for the construction of her house** in Pokhara. The loan reference and purpose are clearly documented.
- These credits appear legitimate, and the loan documentation aligns with the purpose stated in the transaction records, indicating a **well-supported source of funds**.

**Transaction Analysis (Debits):**
- **Debits totaling NPR 4,084,324.16** were observed in 35 transactions between **02/06/2024** and **31/07/2024**, which include:
  - **RTGS debit of NPR 2,800,000.00** to **Raju Gurung** (client’s father-in-law) on **07/07/2024**. The large transfer likely represents financial support for the construction work, as indicated in the loan purpose.
  - **Self-cheque debit of NPR 999,999.00** on the same day, **07/07/2024**, further used for construction or other related purposes.
  - Other smaller debits such as ATM withdrawals, POS transactions, IBANKING transfers, and other miscellaneous expenses are noted but considered **insignificant** in value relative to the larger disbursements.
- The high-value debits, particularly the RTGS transfer to **Raju Gurung** and self-cheque withdrawal, are consistent with the stated purpose of the loan and the family’s involvement in the construction project.

**Counterparty Analysis:**
- **Raju Gurung**, the client’s father-in-law, was the recipient of the **RTGS debit**. During World Check screening, a **potential adverse media match** was flagged but could not be verified due to **insufficient secondary identifiers**. Other screenings (Accuity, Kharon) returned **false positives** or **no match**, mitigating the risk of this being a concern.
- **Sanju Gurung**, the client’s spouse, is also noted as a related party. Her involvement appears to be familial, with no adverse findings or suspicious activities tied to her.

**PEP and AM Screening Results:**
- **Laxman Gurung** was subjected to PEP and AM screening, and **false positives** were noted in Accuity and World Check. **Kharon** returned a **no match**.
- The hits on counterparties, including **Raju Gurung**, were also flagged as **false positives**, reducing any immediate concerns related to potential adverse media.

**Risk-Based Approach (RBA):**
- Given the **clear documentation** of the loan purpose, the **relationship with counterparties**, and the **alignment of transactions with the stated loan purpose**, the risk is deemed to be minimal.
- The **client’s long-standing relationship** with the bank, established employment history, and the **use of funds for family-related purposes** further support a low-risk profile.
- While a **potential match** was found in the case of **Raju Gurung**, the absence of verifying details or adverse media related to the client reduces the likelihood of any significant risk.

**No RFIs Initiated:**
- Based on the **comprehensive review** of the credits and debits, no RFI was required for this case. The transactions were transparent, supported by loan documents, and aligned with the client’s stated financial activities.

**Additional Observations:**
- The **loan documentation** indicates the client’s intention to **support his mother-in-law's house construction** at her plot in Pokhara, which is a plausible and documented reason for the loan.
- The **relationship between the client, his spouse (Sanju Gurung), and his father-in-law (Raju Gurung)** is clear, and the **fund transfers** are aligned with family support for the construction project.
- The client’s **transaction history** shows no pattern of unusual or suspicious financial behavior, with all major transactions tied to the loan proceeds.

**Conclusion:**
- The **source of funds** (loan) and the **utilization of funds** (RTGS debit to Raju Gurung and self-cheque) are **legitimate and supported** by documented evidence.
- The **relationship between the parties** and the **stated purpose of the loan** align with personal and family-related financial activities.
- There is **no indication of suspicious activity** or risk of money laundering in this case.
  
**Disposition: Risk Irrelevant.**
