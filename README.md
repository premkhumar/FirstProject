Salaried at FINNISH EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN MISSION

The term "Opettajien Lähetysyhdistys RY" translates from Finnish to "Teachers' Missionary Association" in English. The abbreviation RY stands for "Rekisteröity Yhdistys," which means "Registered Association" in Finland.

This would suggest that OPETTAJIEN LAHETYSLIITTO RY is a Finnish teachers' missionary association, likely involved in educational or religious missionary activities.

Given this context, the grant for teaching practice is likely to be legitimate financial support provided by this association for the purpose of educational or missionary work related to teaching.

This further solidifies that the source of funds is from a recognized educational or missionary entity, supporting the view that the transaction is low-risk.
